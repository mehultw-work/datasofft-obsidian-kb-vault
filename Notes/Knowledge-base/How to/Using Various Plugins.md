### Intro
One of the best things about Obsidian is how extensible it is with the built in along with community plugins. It adapts to the way you work and is always changing and growing as the user does.



### Context

Using different plugins allows you to add more content, creativity and usability to your vault.

Some of the tools in this article allows us to create more visual notes

## Excalidraw

Allows you to create 'hand-drawn' like graphics to make interactive boards and diagrams. The diagrams could contain wiring instructions, schematic way to represent a setting or a situation, and a learning tool to visualize concepts so people can understand better.

## Mind Mapping

This tool utilizes a way to brainstorm in a manner our brains work. It helps you create a content chart and how different portions of it relates to one another. This is helpful when thinking about a topic to write.

For Eg.
- Start with any topic, for this instance, lets say: Programming languages
- Then when you think about programming languages, you might think of different kinds of languages, so that could be the next nodes of the mind map, 
- We can now put various languages to where they fit in the type of languages
- We can then think about what content to talk about for each  language, and how they could relate

We can create MindMaps from current notes or create a MindMap and add to it by making it a note and filling in the details.

We can display all this visually using a few different tools
- ##### Excalibrain: Displays MindMap based on your Vault Content
- ##### Canvas
- ##### Obsidian MarkMind

## Canvas

Canvas allows you to create an infinite board, basically a digital pane where you can connect notes, drawings, embeddings and more to display content related to a topic.

Here is an example of a JavaScript Canvas MOC (Map of Content)

## Project / Kanban / Tasks

This is a relatively newer plugin that combines a few older ones. 

It allows you to display your tasks, todos and workflow for a project in various forms, be it Kanban, looking at it based on a Calendar, or a Project. 
Info for it is provided by looking at a certain folder or tags to create an interactive dynamic table or kanban board or similar to visualize and update your tasks/notes.

### Conclusions

These are just a few tools that make Obsidian what it is. This document should be updated regularly to add more content, or to change how we do things.
