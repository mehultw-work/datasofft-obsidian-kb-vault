### Intro


Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers. Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that can run consistently across different systems, making it easier to deploy and manage applications. Docker provides a standardized way to build, distribute, and run applications, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.


### Context

Docker is used in dev-ops flow to deploy application locally for development or production such that the output of the *'run'* process is decoupled from the initial base system and how it functions. Basically docker allows users to deploy applications the same way each time irrespective of user's operating systems and settings.

# Docker and Dockerfile Basics for JavaScript Applications


## Dockerfile Basics

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the environment and configuration of the containerized application. Here are some basic concepts and instructions commonly used in a Dockerfile:

- **FROM**: Specifies the base image to build upon. It can be an official image from the Docker Hub registry or a custom image.
- **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory inside the container where subsequent instructions will be executed.
- **COPY**: Copies files from the host machine to the container's filesystem.
- **RUN**: Executes commands inside the container during the build process.
- **CMD**: Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.

## Use Cases and Examples for JavaScript Applications

Docker is particularly useful for JavaScript applications as it provides a consistent environment for development, testing, and deployment. Here are some common use cases and examples for using Docker with JavaScript applications:

1. **Development Environment**: Docker can be used to create a standardized development environment for JavaScript applications. By defining the necessary dependencies and configurations in a Dockerfile, developers can easily set up their development environment on any machine without worrying about compatibility issues.

2. **Containerized Deployment**: With Docker, you can package your JavaScript application and its dependencies into a container. This allows for easy deployment and scaling, as containers can be run on any system that supports Docker. You can use Docker Compose to define multi-container setups for complex applications.

3. **Full-Stack Applications**: Docker can be used to create full-stack applications with different frontend and backend folders, each with their own technology stack. For example, you can have a React frontend and a Node.js backend, each in separate folders, and use Docker to build and run both components together.

4. **Docker Multistage Builds**: Docker multistage builds allow you to optimize the size and efficiency of your Docker images. This is particularly useful for JavaScript applications that require build processes. By using multiple stages in the Dockerfile, you can separate the build dependencies from the final runtime image, resulting in smaller and more efficient containers.

5. **Build Processes and Deployment for Specific Frameworks**: Docker can be used for building and deploying JavaScript frameworks like Next.js, React, Vite, and Svelte. Each framework may have its own specific requirements and build processes, but Docker provides a consistent and reproducible environment for these tasks.

## Creating a Basic Full-Stack Application with Docker

Here is an example of how you can create a basic full-stack application with different frontend and backend folders, using Docker:

1. Create two separate folders for the frontend and backend of your application.

2. In the frontend folder, create a Dockerfile that defines the build process for your frontend application. This may include installing dependencies, building the frontend assets, and exposing the necessary ports.

3. In the backend folder, create a Dockerfile that defines the build process for your backend application. This may include installing dependencies, setting up the database, and exposing the necessary ports.

4. Use Docker Compose to define a multi-container setup that runs both the frontend and backend containers together. Docker Compose allows you to define the services, networks, and volumes required for your application.

5. Build and run the Docker containers using Docker Compose. This will create the necessary containers, network, and volumes defined in your Docker Compose file and start your full-stack application.

By using Docker, you can easily manage and deploy your full-stack application with different frontend and backend technology stacks, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

Docker is a powerful tool for building, deploying, and managing JavaScript applications. With Docker and Dockerfile, you can create reproducible and scalable environments for your applications. Whether you're developing a simple JavaScript app or a complex full-stack application, Docker provides a standardized and efficient way to package and run your code

## Docker Compose Basics and Use Cases

**Docker Compose Basics:** Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container applications using a YAML configuration file. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage complex applications with multiple services. Docker Compose eliminates the need to manually run and link containers, making it easier to orchestrate and scale your application.

**Use Cases and Examples:** Here are some common use cases and examples for Docker Compose:

1. **Development Environments**: Docker Compose is commonly used to create development environments that closely resemble the production environment. By defining multiple services in the Docker Compose file, developers can easily spin up the required dependencies and services with a single command, ensuring consistency across different development setups.

2. **Microservices Architecture**: Docker Compose is well-suited for managing microservices architectures. Each microservice can be defined as a separate service in the Docker Compose file, allowing for easy scaling and orchestration of the different components of the application.

3. **Testing and Continuous Integration**: Docker Compose can be integrated into testing and continuous integration workflows. Developers can define the necessary services and dependencies in the Docker Compose file and easily spin up the required environment for running tests or performing continuous integration tasks.

4. **Local Development with Databases**: Docker Compose is often used to set up local development environments that require databases. By defining a database service in the Docker Compose file, developers can easily spin up a containerized database instance without the need for manual installation and configuration.

5. **Staging and Production Environments**: Docker Compose can also be used to define and manage staging and production environments. By defining the required services, networks, and volumes in the Docker Compose file, you can easily deploy and scale your application in a consistent and reproducible manner.

## Dockerfile and Docker Compose Code for Multistage Builds

Here are examples of Dockerfile and Docker Compose code for different multistage builds for Next.js, React, Vite, and Svelte:

#### Next.js Multistage Dockerfile:

```YAML
# Build stage
FROM node:14 AS build

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json . 
COPY yarn.lock . 

RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile

COPY . . 

RUN yarn build


# Production stage

FROM node:14-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build /app/package.json . 
COPY --from=build /app/yarn.lock . 
COPY --from=build /app/.next ./.next 
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile --production EXPOSE 3000 CMD ["yarn", "start"]

```

# Dockerizing Svelte, Redis Node app

##### Introduction:
 Docker has revolutionized the way we package, deploy, and scale applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Docker, Dockerfile, and Docker Compose to containerize a Svelte frontend, Redis, and Node backend project. We will cover everything from setting up the folder structure to writing the Dockerfiles and Docker Compose file for a seamless development and deployment experience.

**Folder Structure:** Before diving into the Docker setup, let's define the folder structure for our project:
![[docker-full-stack-folder-structure.png.png]]

The "frontend" folder houses the Svelte frontend code, while the "backend" folder contains the Node backend code. The Dockerfile for each component will reside within its respective folder, making it easier to manage and build each service independently.

**Multistage Dockerfile for the Frontend:** In the frontend folder, create a Dockerfile with the following content:
```YAML
# Use Node.js 14, name this stage 'frontend' 
FROM node:14 AS frontend 
# Set the working directory within the image 
WORKDIR /build 
# Copy package and lock files then install dependencies 
COPY package.json . 
COPY package-lock.json . 
RUN npm install 
# Copy the rest of the files for the frontend 
COPY rollup.config.js . 
COPY svelte-app ./svelte-app 
# Build the Svelte app - this'll output files to /build/wwwroot 
RUN npm run build
```

This Dockerfile sets up a multistage build using the "node:14" image. It starts with the "frontend" stage, where we copy the necessary files, install the frontend dependencies, and build the Svelte app. The resulting production-ready assets will be placed in the "/build/wwwroot" directory.

**Multistage Dockerfile for the Backend:** In the backend folder, create a Dockerfile with the following content:
```YAML
# Use Node.js 14, name this stage 'backend' 
FROM node:14 AS backend 

# Set the working directory within the image 
WORKDIR /app 

# Copy package and lock files then install dependencies 
COPY package.json . 
COPY package-lock.json . 
RUN npm install 

# Copy the rest of the files for the backend 
COPY index.js . 
COPY ... 

# Set environment variables if needed 
ENV REDIS_HOST=redis ENV REDIS_PORT=6379 

# Start the backend server 
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

In the backend Dockerfile, we define a multistage build named "backend". Similar to the frontend Dockerfile, we copy the necessary files, install backend dependencies, and set up environment variables for connecting to Redis. Finally, we start the Node backend server.

**Docker Compose:** To connect all the components together, we'll use Docker Compose. Create a "docker-compose.yml" file in the project root folder:
```YAML
version: '3' 
services: 
	frontend:
	 build:
	  context: ./frontend
	  dockerfile: Dockerfile
	 ports: - 8081:8081
    backend:
     build: 
	     context: ./backend
	      dockerfile: Dockerfile
	 ports:
	  - 8080:8080 
	 redis:
	  image:
	   redis:latest
```

The Docker Compose file defines three services: frontend, backend, and redis. We specify the build context and Dockerfile for each service and map the container ports to the host machine ports. In our setup, the frontend will be accessible at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/), the backend at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/), and Redis will use the default configuration.

**Running the Project:** To build and run the project, navigate to the project root folder and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up

```
This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for the frontend, backend, and Redis. You can now access your Svelte frontend, Redis, and Node backend at the specified ports.

### Conclusions:
In this blog post, we explored how to use Docker, Dockerfile, and Docker Compose to containerize a Svelte frontend, Redis, and Node backend project. We learned about the folder structure, set up the Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend, and created a Docker Compose file to connect all the components.

Dockerizing our project offers numerous benefits, including consistency, scalability, and ease of deployment. Now, you have a solid foundation to containerize your own full-stack applications using Docker. Happy coding!
